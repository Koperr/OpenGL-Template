note: this is my first ever created public repo, and first ever configured project in cmake.
I installed Linux the day before creating this repo and first time ever created and used cmake and cripts.
What am i trying to say? Sth may be wrong cuz im still learning
Feedback is welcome, if necessary
# OpenGL template project, uses cmake
### Clone this repo:
```
gh repo clone Koperr/OpenGL-Template
```

### Golden quote - "It works on my machine"
**you may need to make those bash scriptrs below executable, so in the project directory paste this:**
```
chmod +x setupCMake.sh compile.sh run.sh
```
**setup cmake**
```
./setupCMake.sh
```
**compile/build**
```
./compile.sh
```
**run**
```
./run.sh
```
another note:
if sth is wrong, delete `build` dir (```rm -rf build/```) and type commands showed above
